        Cloudbase Solutions is organizing a Python & DevOps training
        in Iasi. In this effort we will mentor and assist a group of
        10 students over a period of 2 weeks, covering the following
        topics: Python, Git, Linux / Windows and shell scripting
        (Bash / PowerShell).
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        We’re doing this because we like open source projects and we
        love Python. It’s a small community, but we want to see it grow.
        Whether it’s OpenStack or any other open source project, we hope
        that after 2 weeks you’ll start contributing to community driven
        projects and want to get involved in open source.
