        CloudbaseLABS is a training program developed by Cloudbase Solutions
        in the fields of Python programming, OpenStack and DevOps technologies
        and practices.
    
        We’ve been delivering this program in Timisoara for the past 2 years
        with great feedback from participants. Starting from 2016 we’ve decided
        to expand it to other cities in Romania as well.

        The goal of these workshops are to help students become familiar with
        Python as a programming language, find out about OpenStack and other
        popular cloud tools, embrace DevOps practices and promote open source
        projects.
        After graduating, students will have the basic skills they need
        in order to start tackling many open source projects and land their
        first contribution.
