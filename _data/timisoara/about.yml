        Cloudbase Solutions is partnering with the Computer Science
        student organization from the “Politehnica” University of
        Timisoara in delivering a full semester of Python, OpenStack
        and Hyper-V hands-on workshops. The goal of this workshop is
        to be able to deploy an OpenStack cloud for development purposes,
        understand the general concepts and architecture, be able to
        look under the hood and debug, test previously implemented
        features and be able to fix simple reported bugs and start
        implementing Python code.
