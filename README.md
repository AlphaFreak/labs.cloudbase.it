##About Cloudbase LABS

Cloudbase Solutions is a startup that strives to grow the open-source community.

Our goal is to help as many students as possible to grow and to learn new technologies that we believe will be applied in the future, to make the world a better place for all of us.

For fulfilling this mission, we designed multiple community projects, Cloudbase LABS being one of them. This event brings together Cloudbase specialists, enthusiastic students and not only.
